# GeoToll

GeoToll is an android application that aims to eliminate the use of cash at road tolls. This is an effort to promote cashless transactions for toll payments and simultaneously, enable the user to pre-pay the toll before the journey starts, in case the users do not have internet connection on the go. The users' efforts are minimized by enabling GeoLocation, that is, tagging nearby tolls and creating a boundary, which triggers a notification if entered into, and redirects the user to the payment gateway. Provision for two way journey is also provided in the application.
